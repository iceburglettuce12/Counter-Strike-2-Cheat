# External Cheat for Counter Strike 2
Based on TKazer's iteration on previous CS2 cheats. Modified several calls and added substantial amount of obfuscation and polymorphism in an effort to keep it safe from VACnet for the forseeable future. Also compiled and am only publishing the binary to keep the obfuscation methods as hidden as possible from Valve. At the very least, it should slow them down since debugging this will take a lot of work with out source.

# Note
On Windows 11, Windows Smart screen may prevent you from running, in which case you can click "More info" and run anyway. This is because smart screen triggers with essentially any .exe file that was downloaded from the internet and is not signed. 

You shouldn't have to disable anti-virus since there's no hooking/injection, but again, it is an unsigned executable, so if you have problems with it, disabling temporarily might fix. 

In my tests, only smart screen triggered, but anti-virus did not.
